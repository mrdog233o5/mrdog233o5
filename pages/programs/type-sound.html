                    <h1>Installation</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>download type-sound files, which is all in this zip file: <a href="https://github.com/mrdog233o5/type-sound/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">zip</a></li>
                        <li>unzip the it by double click it and put the folder in anywhere you want</li>
                        <li>a terminal emulator, all the steps after will be done in this app using command line</li>
                        <li>change directory into the type-sound folder using <span class="codeBlock">cd (path of the folder)</span></li>
                        <li>setup all the files of type-sound, you can use the script i made to automatically setup: <span class="codeBlock">bash ./setup.sh</span></li>
                        <li>install homebrew from <a href="https://brew.sh/">https://brew.sh/</a></li>
                        <li>install python by <span class="codeBlock">brew install python3</span></li>
                        <li>then install all the packages by doing <span class="codeBlock">pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt</span></li>
                        <li>now all of the basic files are installed, to be able to use type-sound, you MUST read #config page to be able to use type-sound (this step doesnt have to be done with command line)</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="info">
                    <h1>Config</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>find ANY sound you want.</li>
                        <li>convert the sound you got to .WAV format using any tools, i suggest <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/">cloudconvert</a> because it is free, but you can use any tools you want, as long as the output sound is in .WAV format.</li>
                        <li>put the sound files EXACTLY like this: <br>
                            (pack_name) #any name you like for the pack, it need to end with .pack <br>
                            ├── press.wav #sound played when pressed a key <br>
                            ├── release.wav #sound played when released a key <br>
                            ├── mousePress.wav #sound played when pressed mouse <br>
                            └── mouseRelease.wav #sound played when released mouse</li>
                        <li>put the whole folder directly into ~/.config/type-sound/sounds, or /Users/(your user name)/.config/type-sound/sound/sounds this is a hidden folder, so you have to press command+shift+period(.) to see it.</li>
                        <li>he sound pack is added correctly if you followed the steps above correctly. To tell type-sound to use that sound pack, open ~/.config/type-sound/type-sound.json aka /Users/(your user name)/.config/type-sound/type-sound.json with a text editor.</li>
                        <li>when you open it, it should look like something like this:  
                            <div class="codeBlock">
                                {<br>
                                    "pack":(soundpack that you are using),<br>
                                }
                            </div>
                            replace the pack opton with the pack you are using, makesure it end with .pack
                        </li>
                        <li>remember to save and reopen type-sound when you made any changes</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </section>
        </div>
        <script src="/src/js/header.js"></script>
